        "about": "The What and Why: BCG’s 60-year history has always begun with Strategy. For decades, it’s been deeply ingrained in our firm’s DNA, brand, and value proposition. While we can be proud of our roots, the truth is: Strategy has evolved. In this ever-changing new world, Strategy is now predominantly a capability to make sense of the shifts occurring globally. Only once you’ve embraced this capability can you think strategically to gain and sustain competitive advantage.",
